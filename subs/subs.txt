This is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching algorithm.
Is it possible to do better with genomic data? 

Maybe if we represent base-pairs as 2-bits of information,
A = 00
T = 11
C = 01
G = 10

Then a sequence to search for, like ATAT, is represented as 00110011

Then a sequence like GATATATGCATATACTT, is represented as 

1000110011...

Depending on the length of the sequence, we may be able to do some
bin-sorting for partial matches and thus do better than Knuth-Morris-Pratt.
